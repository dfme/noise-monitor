noise-monitor
=============
Noise Monitor is an application for Android which allows the user to monitor sound with the telephoneâ€™s built in microphone. If the application detects noise exceeding a certain threshold a predefined telephone number is called to alert the user.

It is suggested to connect your device to the power adapter during a monitor session. If this is not possible the application will monitor your battery health. When the power reaches a critical level a SMS is sent to the predefined number alerting the user of low power.

If you have any suggestions or issues with the application please let me know.
